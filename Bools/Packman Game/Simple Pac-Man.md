Instructions
In this exercise, you need to implement some rules from Pac-Man, the classic 1980s-era arcade-game.

You have four rules to implement, all related to the game states.

1. Define the eat_ghost() function that takes two parameters (if Pac-Man has a power pellet active and if Pac-Man is touching a ghost) and returns a Boolean value if Pac-Man is able to eat the ghost. The function should return True only if Pac-Man has a power pellet active and is touching a ghost.

>>> eat_ghost(False, True)
...
False

2. Define the score() function that takes two parameters (if Pac-Man is touching a power pellet and if Pac-Man is touching a dot) and returns a Boolean value if Pac-Man scored. The function should return True if Pac-Man is touching a power pellet or a dot.

>>> score(True, True)
...
True

3. Define the lose() function that takes two parameters (if Pac-Man has a power pellet active and if Pac-Man is touching a ghost) and returns a Boolean value if Pac-Man loses. The function should return True if Pac-Man is touching a ghost and does not have a power pellet active.

>>> lose(False, True)
...
True

4. Define the win() function that takes three parameters (if Pac-Man has eaten all of the dots, if Pac-Man has a power pellet active, and if Pac-Man is touching a ghost) and returns a Boolean value if Pac-Man wins. The function should return True if Pac-Man has eaten all of the dots and has not lost based on the parameters defined in part 3.

>>> win(False, True, False)
...
False
